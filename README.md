# Numerical Analysis

## Introduction
This repository contains my implementation of numerical analysis methods to solve a linear system of equations. The implemented methods are:

* Gaussian elimination
* LU decomposition
* Jacobi method
* Gauss-Seidel method

## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## How to Use the Application

1. Open the application in your web browser.
2. Click the "+" button to add a new equation to the system.
3. Click the "-" button to remove the last equation from the system.
4. Choose a computation method from the dropdown menu.
5. Click the "Compute" button to compute the solution for the system.

## Constraints

* The number of unknown variables should be equal to the number of equations.
* Equation format: ax + by + cz = m, where {a, b, c} belongs to R (real numbers). For example, 9x - y + 5z = 12 is a valid equation.
